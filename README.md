# 👨‍💻 [Brian Agbamuche] - 🚀 [Maze Solving AI]

Welcome to my Year 13 (AQA) NEA coursework project repository. This document outlines the project's overview, structure, and key information.

📝 **Please replace all placeholder text in `[...]` with your specific project details.**

## 📖 Project Description

`Brief Overview: My project is centred around how to go about traversing a maze via an AI rather than a pre defined, traditional way such as the A* Maze Algorithm. It uses the Markov Decision Process along with a numpy defined Neural Network structure to achieve this, using a reward system structure.`

## 🗂 Repository Structure

- **docs/**: Contains project documentation and briefs (if you used any).
- **src/**: Where your project's source code resides.
  - **main/**: Main application code.
  - **test/**: Code for testing your application (if you used any).
- **assets/**: For any project assets like images, diagrams, or data files.
- **lib/**: External libraries not managed by package managers.
- **reports/**: For your project reports or written analysis (Your NEA report).

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

`Nothing really is required, just python installed and all of the it's pre installed libraries.`

## 🛠 Usage

`Run the main.py. Then select machine learning and then make maze. Then u will be given a gif after training`
